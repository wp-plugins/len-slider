Use the shortcode `[lenslider]` (shortode button is already installed on your WYSIWYG bar) in the content area of a page or post where you want the image slider to appear or PHP code `<?php if( class_exists( 'LenSlider' ) ) {LenSlider::lenslider_output_slider( 'your slider hash ID here - with lower(!) case letters' );}?>` in your template files

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I’ve made slider with default template, then decided to change the skin, chose the required one, saved the data and the slider became disabled. =

Yes, this is right. Activate the slider with help of radiobuttons and save the data. Note: when you change the skin of the slider, it becomes inactive (turned off), because each skin has its own settings that may not correspond to the slider’s filled fields. When you save the data again the mistakes can be revealed and corrected afterwards.

= What does "maximum width of uploaded image, px" mean? =

Each banner of the slider has some image/photo and it has maximal (recommended) width in pixels (usually on websites width dominates over height). This figure limits the width of the image that you download, i.e. if the image is wider, then it will be automatically resized to the required width with preserved ratio. In case the width is equal to the maximal possible parameter or smaller than that, then the image will not change. One can set any figure in the range 30-1200 pixels.

= How can I insert necessary slider with shortcode if I do not remember its hash-number? =

If you have installed plugin, then the button LenSlider should appear in the admin panel in the section of adding new post/page/custom post type in the bar WYSIWYG of the editor. Press this button and you will understand how it works.

= What does "Maximal quality of uploaded image" mean? =

The default parameter is 90. That means that the image that you download will lose in quality a little, but its weight in kilobytes will be lower and this will increase download speed of a page with a slider. In other words, this is a small contribution to download speed in client’s area. You can change this figure from 60 to 100.

= Can I display multiple sliders on one page? =

Yes you can!

= Where can I edit CSS for slider and how can I change width and height of the slider’s block? =

All files of skins are in the folder `lenslider/skins/your-skin-name`, and css-file, js-scripts and technical images are located in the folder `lenslider/skins/your-skin-name/output`. Unfortunately, this is not possible to change slider’s CSS parameters In the current version of plugin, such as margin, padding and so on, but *it is planned to develop the plugin and add these features in the future*.

= What kind of setting is "floating hint tipsy"? =

If you switch on this option hints in the admin LenSlider will be shown in nice floating title with help of jQuery-plugin [tipsy](http://onehackoranother.com/projects/jquery/tipsy/).
